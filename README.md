# GameShopper
Final year project for Diploma in Information Technology (2020)

## Introduction
GameShopper is an online shopping platform for users to browse and purchase games.

## Project Objectives 
### To provide a platform for gamers that is user friendly for customers.
The platform will be fast loading and clean user interface. It will be very simple and straightforward on how to use/operate the website. Easy to find links. All the buttons and links will be clearly visible to avoid unnecessary click.
### To provide a cheaper option for users with more competitive pricing.
We aim to provide a more competitive price for our customers. We believe this will be achieved as we don’t have a physical store so our expenses will be reduced to a minimal.
###	To reduce customer time on shopping as they are not needed to leave the house.
With online shopping and online payment provided, customers shopping time will be significantly reduced. Customers wouldn’t need to leave their house and waste their time browsing the item in a physical store.
